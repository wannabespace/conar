# Code standards (Ultracite)

Lint + format = **Ultracite** (Oxlint + Oxfmt preset): `pnpm run check` (read-only), `pnpm run fix` (autofix), or per-file `pnpm oxlint --fix <paths>` + `pnpm oxfmt <paths>`. Most style issues are autofixable — run `fix` and spend attention on what it cannot check: naming, business logic, architecture, edge cases.

`oxlint.config.ts` turns rules **off** only where a preset rule contradicts how this repo works, each with the reason inline. A rule that merely fails is a defect to fix, not an entry to add. Directives that suppress nothing: `pnpm exec oxlint -c oxlint.config.ts --report-unused-disable-directives <paths>`.

Lint vetoes some obvious rewrites: `no-nested-ternary` (a three-way value is an `if` chain); `prefer-array-index-of` rejects `findIndex((x) => x === v)`, so an `indexOf(… as HTMLElement)` cast stays; `hook-use-state` rejects destructuring an object state in the `useState` line — take `[thing, setThing]` and destructure on the next line.

## Design-system lint (`@shadcn/lint`)

The `shadcn/*` rules enforce the `tamery-ui` hard rules: `no-restyle` is rule 11, `no-raw-colors` and `no-arbitrary-values` keep values on theme tokens, `no-inline-styles` sends dynamic values through CSS custom properties (`w-(--x)` + `style={{ '--x': … }}`).

- A `no-restyle` finding means the kit is missing a `variant`/`size`/prop — add it in `packages/ui`, never silence the call site. `packages/ui/src/components/**` is exempt from `no-restyle`, `no-arbitrary-values` and `require-static-classes`: components own their appearance.
- Call sites may always pass layout, motion, `opacity` (hover reveals, display-only disabled state), `truncate` and the scroller utilities. A component that owns no surface (`ScrollArea`, raw primitive triggers, layout containers) gets a **contract** in `oxlint.config.ts` widening what call sites may pass; a contract is never a shortcut around a missing variant on a component that does own a surface.
- `require-static-classes` needs class strings the linter can read in the same file — no class names passed in as data or built by a helper; ternaries of literals and `cn(…, cond && '…')` are fine.
- A disable is the last resort and always says why: `// oxlint-disable-next-line shadcn/<rule> -- <reason>` (third-party code that only accepts inline styles, a value no token can describe).
- Theme discovery reads the nearest `components.json`: a workspace that renders kit classes but lacks one (`apps/main`, `packages/table`) carries a minimal one pointing at the kit's `globals.css`, or `no-unknown-classes` falls back to stock Tailwind.

## No import cycles, no star barrels

`import/no-cycle` and `oxc/no-barrel-file` are on repo-wide and the tree satisfies both — keep it that way rather than adding an override.

- **A module that composes children must not also define what they import.** That mix produced every cycle here: an entry, registry or barrel exporting a contract or singleton its own children reach back for. Put the shared piece in a leaf below both — contracts in `types.ts`, a driver toolkit beside its registry, stores beside their helpers, infrastructure beside the router that composes it.
- **A factory takes what it depends on; it does not look itself up.** A collection's own utils close over the collection rather than reading it back out of `getCollections()`; operations that *do* need the registry live outside the factory module.
- **No `export *` anywhere; re-export by name.** Star exports trip `no-barrel-file` once a folder pulls >100 modules and they hide what a path actually offers. A package's public folder API stays a barrel of explicit names; app code has no `core/*` re-export barrels — import the leaf that owns the symbol (`architecture.md` explains the bundling cost).
- Type-only imports count: `import type` still closes a cycle for the linter.
- The tanstack preset turns `sort-keys` **off** under `**/routes/**`, so code moved from a route into `core/`, a module outside its `routes/`, or `packages/` can surface fresh `sort-keys` errors it never had.

## Repo-specific, not linted

- The app is unreleased: no compatibility shims, aliases or migration fallbacks are owed.
- React 19: `ref` as a prop, no `forwardRef`. No `useMemo`/`useCallback` (`architecture.md` → Memoization) — but `react-hooks(exhaustive-deps)` outranks that: where it demands a stable identity, the memo stays.
- Separate seitu `useSubscription`s that feed effect deps stay separate: it deep-compares selector results, so folding them into one `pick` changes which references the effect sees.
- Kit variants live in `<component>.utils.ts` as `cva`, not as a record inside the `.tsx`.
- **A file holds one subject.** A second component, a hook with its own state, a layout branch or a helper set goes in its own file, however short the file is; 300 lines is the ceiling, not the trigger, and one past it is always more than one subject. Split by subject, and move anything not tied to a Tamery feature into the package that owns the library (Monaco plumbing into `@tamery/monaco`).
- **A file is named after its subject; `utils.ts` is the only generic name.** Never `lib`, `helpers`, `shared`, `common`, `module` — one word or none. `utils.ts` is the leftover bin for unrelated one-offs with no shared subject, at most one per folder; a file with a real subject takes the subject's name (`base64.ts`, `slugify.ts`, `layout.ts`). A nested `utils/` **folder** is the same word twice — put the files at the parent level instead; the one exception is an app's `src/utils/` (`architecture.md` → Core layout).
- **Use the type the dependency exports.** Never rebuild a library type from its parts or copy its fields (`Readable & Subscribable & Writable` for seitu's `WebStorageValue`, `readonly unknown[]` for `QueryKey`, `ReturnType<typeof useRouter>` for `RegisteredRouter`). A shape with an ArkType schema has one source: its type is `typeof schema.infer`, never a hand-written copy kept in sync.
- **A cast is a smell.** Narrow, or model the shape in ArkType instead of `as` — a schema deletes both the cast and the validation gap. A surviving cast sits at a wire boundary with a warning comment saying why.
- A magic number gets a name, not a comment explaining it; a value with no reason behind it gets no constant either.
- Modern built-ins (`toSorted`, `at(-1)`, `Object.groupBy`, `Array.fromAsync`, …) over hand-rolled loops and copy-then-mutate — every runtime here supports them. Only when shorter *and* clearer; don't chain five methods where `for...of` reads better.
- No `.only`/`.skip` in committed tests.
- Arktype's builder is imported bare: `import { type } from 'arktype'` — never aliased. A local binding that would shadow it (a `type: ConnectionType` prop) gets renamed instead (`connectionType`), since `no-shadow` is on.
- `useState` used only to freeze a first-render value keeps the setter plus a `void setThing` line — `hook-use-state` rejects a lone `const [thing] =`. Dropping the setter is a lint error, not a cleanup.
- Swallowing a failure on purpose (cleanup, best-effort side effect) goes through `silently()` from `@tamery/shared/utils` — no bare empty `catch`. A failure that needs a fallback value uses `tryCatch`/`tryCatchAsync`.
- **Related operations around one concept live in one object** — a Redis key and its ops, a model registry, a client's verbs (`const activeStream = { claim, get, key, release }`), not loose top-level functions: the import site names the concept once and the object is the unit of ownership. Group only where functions share state or a key builder; independent pure helpers and single-function modules stay flat. `sort-keys` is on, so keys go alphabetical.
- **A helper with one caller is inlined.** A named helper at one call site (a validator, a key builder, a formatter) buys an extra name and a jump; write the code where it runs. Name it only when it is reused, recursive, or inlining pushes the caller past `complexity` — and prefer a schema or library option over a hand-rolled helper. The exception is a **default prop value**: `no-object-type-as-default-prop` rejects an inline function or object there, so those stay hoisted consts.
- **Name for the thing, not the mechanism.** The object is the subject and the method the verb, so the call site reads as a sentence (`chatStream.resume(chatId)`). A name describing the data structure or the plumbing (`pointer`, `map`, `handler`) tells a reader nothing; if the concept cannot be named, the grouping is wrong. No stutter — the object already carries the noun, so drop the repeat from the method.
