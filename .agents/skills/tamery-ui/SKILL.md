Use whenever building, restyling, or reviewing any UI in this repo (components, pages, popovers, menus, animations), before writing the first className.

# Tamery UI

Native-feeling macOS database client (Electron + React + Tailwind v4 + base-ui kit in `packages/ui`). Every screen reads like an Apple app, not a web page. Owner-established rules; hard rules are review blockers.

Topic files — read what the task touches; record new decisions in the matching file:

| File | When |
|---|---|
| [colors.md](colors.md) | Colors, surfaces, glass, shadows, cell highlights |
| [typography.md](typography.md) | Fonts, type scale, row heights, radius |
| [patterns.md](patterns.md) | Chrome: menus, tabs, panes, tooltips, toasts, icons, filter field, forms, shortcuts |
| [motion.md](motion.md) | Any animation |
| [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) | Before debugging kit components |

## Hard rules

0. **Search the registry before writing markup.** `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest search @shadcn -q <term>`. A `div` stack re-implementing a registry component (`Item`, `Empty`, `InputGroup`, `Field`, `ButtonGroup`, `Attachment`…) is a review blocker, including "just this once". Missing from `packages/ui` → vendor it (`shadcn view @shadcn/<name>`), rewrite imports to kit conventions, then use. Registry components carry the density, focus rings, hover states and data-slots the app relies on. Long-form text is never hand-parsed: prose via kit `Response`, fenced code via `CodeBlock` or `ResponseCodeBlock`.
1. **No `dark:` selectors.** Theme tokens resolve in both themes; no new theme-pair vars. A token pair lacking contrast → cross-theme constructions in [colors.md](colors.md). Test: **several call sites each dialing their own alpha on one token = the token is wrong.**
2. **No pixel font sizes.** Tokens only (`text-2xs`…`text-base`+); a missing size gets a rem token in `@theme`.
3. **No `cursor-pointer`.** `cursor-default` on link-based controls; I-beam and col-resize are the only exceptions.
4. **Kit-level fixes** in `packages/ui` for systemic sizing or color problems; page overrides only for page-specific design. Sizes via size props, never per-page `h-*`.
5. **No bare interactive icons.** Hover bg + color shift + tooltip, always ([patterns.md](patterns.md)).
6. **No `sidebar-*` color tokens.** Regular tokens everywhere.
7. **Global anchor rule:** `a { text-primary }` in globals — row-styled `Link`s must set `text-foreground` or render blue.
8. **`data-mask` on all user data.** Any element rendering user values (connection names, hosts, connection strings, schema/table/column names, cell values, SQL, filter values) gets it so screen-recording tools can blur it. App chrome never. Put it on the closest element wrapping only the user value.
9. **Verify heights in a row.** After touching any control sharing a line with others, measure every element's `getBoundingClientRect().height` in the browser — equal to the pixel. Classic traps: `py-*` plus fixed-height children exceeding `min-h`, borders without `bg-clip-padding`, hand-set `h-*` instead of size props.
10. **Refresh belongs to the tab bar, never to the page.** `TabRefresh` owns refreshing the active tab: a refreshable tab type gets a branch there (invalidate its query keys, `useRefreshHotkey`, render the button) and its page ships **no** refresh control. A tab type that cannot refresh keeps the button mounted and `disabled`. Two buttons for one dataset read as two refreshes and both fire on ⌘R.
11. **A className on a kit component is a missing prop.** Call sites pass `size`/`variant` and own only layout — position, flex sizing, `min-h-0`, a width, an animation, a behaviour utility. The moment a page re-dials a kit component's *surface* (padding, radius, background, border, font size, height) the kit is wrong for that context and gets a variant. One override is a smell; a stack of them on one element, or the same override at two call sites, is a review blocker. Rule 4 says where a fix lives; this says what a call site may write.
12. **Every feature is operable from the keyboard, and Escape always walks back to the Navigator.** A new surface ships its keyboard flow in the same task: arrows move *within* a surface, Enter (or Right, into a detail pane) descends, Escape ascends. **Escape is a ladder, never a jump** — it undoes the innermost state first (clear a search, then leave the field, then close the panel), one step per press, so enough presses from anywhere land on the Navigator. A handler that swallows Escape must have consumed a step (`stopPropagation` only after handling it), or the ladder breaks above it. An opening surface puts focus somewhere useful (`initialFocus`) and closing returns it to the trigger; nothing traps focus in a leaf with no way out. **Keys are registered with `useHotkey`/`useHotkeys` from `@tanstack/react-hotkeys`** — never a hand-rolled `addEventListener` and never a container's `onKeyDown` (which also drags a11y roles onto plain wrappers). `target` scopes a binding to one element's ref, so in-surface navigation and app-wide shortcuts use the same hook and show up together in its devtools.
13. **Holding ⌘ reveals the shortcuts.** Every shortcut a surface answers to becomes visible when the user holds ⌘ for a beat and disappears on release — hints sit on the controls they fire, drawn with the kit `shortcuts.tsx` glyphs, never gathered into a cheatsheet the user has to find. A shortcut with nowhere to appear is undiscoverable. Show only what fires in the current context (gate Electron-only ones on `window.electron`, hide what is disabled), and reserve or overlay the space — revealing a hint must not reflow its row.
