## 1. Introduction

Conar ("we," "our," "us"), owned by Wannabe Space, LLC, is a database management application. This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how we store and protect it, and what we never touch.

## 2. What We Store

### Account and Session Data

- Name, email address, optional profile photo
- Authentication data: session tokens, login method, IP address, user agent
- Subscription and billing status (processed via Stripe)

### Connection Information

Database connection details (host, port, type, username) are **always encrypted locally** using AES-256-GCM with a user-specific key. Passwords are **never sent to our servers by default** — they stay on your device. If you explicitly enable cloud sync for a connection, an encrypted version (password included) is stored in our cloud infrastructure. You can disable this at any time.

### Chat History

AI conversation history is stored both locally on your device and synced to our cloud servers to enable access across devices.

### Analytics

Anonymized usage events collected via PostHog (EU servers). Session recording is enabled with all database inputs and data masked.

## 3. What We Never Store

- **Your database contents** — rows, query results, table data. All queries run directly between your device and your database. This data never passes through our servers.
- **Unencrypted credentials** — passwords are never stored in plain text, anywhere.

## 4. What We Send to AI Providers

When you use AI features, we send:

- Your database **schema** (table names, column names, types, enums) — never raw row data
- Your chat messages and query context

In rare cases, an AI model may invoke a database query tool to fetch a limited number of rows to assist you — this only happens as part of an explicit AI action, not automatically. Sensitive columns are masked when possible.

AI requests are routed to **Anthropic** (primary), **OpenAI**, and **Google** as fallback providers depending on the feature.

## 7. Your Responsibilities — Backups and Risk

**You are solely responsible for maintaining your own backups of your databases and their contents.** We do not back up your database data.

We implement reasonable security measures, but no system is fully secure. **We do not take responsibility for any data loss, corruption, or unauthorized access or leak** — whether on your side, your database provider's side, or our side. You use Conar at your own risk.

## 8. Your Rights

- **View / Export**: Access your personal data and request a copy
- **Update**: Modify your profile at any time
- **Delete**: Permanently delete your account and all associated data
